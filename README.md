## The Fire Level
The fire level consists of the player, a weapon pick up, 3 targets, 3 ammo pickups, __ health pickups, and 6 hazards the player can be damaged by.\
The weapon pickup is put in front of the player to get them moving, starting with zero ammo.\
The pickups found near the targets give the player five bullets, the perfect amount to remove the targets.\
Ammo is given to the player by checking for collision overlap with the player, and then increasing the ammo count of the player by a pickup amount.\
